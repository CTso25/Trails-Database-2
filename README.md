# Trail-It Database

U.S. National parks draw nearly 330 million annual visitors, and the numbers have increased drastically within the past 10 years. As the number of park visitors increases, so do concerns about human impact, such as trail conditions and animal habitats.

The purpose of this project was to develop a centralized resource for park and trail information. Although other apps such as AllTrails provide information about trails, they lack a recommendation system based on user preferences and updated trail conditions. This project creates a SQL back-end database with three goals in mind: 1) Recommend Hikes based on user preferences, 2) Animal sightings and trail condition reporting, and 3) Monitor visitor traffic through QR check-ins. The Flask API was used to develop a user interface.
